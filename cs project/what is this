A project I found that is very relevant.

Our project will focus on the ethical implications of the government's use of massive surveillance on the US population. The questions that surround this debate are as old as the Magna Carta and as relevant as the fight against global terrorism: What are the ethics of warrantless search? Should liberty ever be sacrificed for national security? How should companies respond to illegal government requests? How does this surveillance fit in with legal precedent within the US and how does it compare to the actions of other nations?
