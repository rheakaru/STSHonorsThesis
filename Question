What are the different ways of UNDERSTANDING government technological surveillance?
How do these different understandings evolve?
  what experiences prompt these understandings?
  what do they draw on?
  what groups do they resonate strongly in?
  How do these narratives change based on age, education, exposure to news etc? 
    What are other relevant categories? 
How do they inform each other? 
  How can these ideas/expectations be shared? 
How do people's expectations change based on their understanding?
How do people's behaviours change based on their understanding?
What do people believe about consumer technology based on their views? (helpful/intrusive/corporate/counter culture)
What do people believe about the government based on their views? (safety/dangerous/clever/secretive)


Additionally: 
Identify major "facts" or ideas that people take for granted
Identify the beliefs that are violated by learning something new
Way that technical systems are communicated to the public
The costs of understanding and the benefits of modifying behaviour based on that understanding
